JamSesh is a social networking app for musicians with the intent of connecting for collaboration purposes!
Find musicians based on what type of instruments and genres they specialize in!

To run the app, navigate to /backend in the terminal and run "python run.py" and in a seperate terminal navigate to /frontend and run "npm start" 

You now have the ability to register a profile with your email, and login once you've successfully done so.

From your main page, you have the option to write a bio about yourself, stating your intentions for connecting, add a profile picture, list the instruments and genres you play. It is strongly recommended that you list any specific musical interests or accomplishments! 

In the main navigation bar, you also have the option to "search" for users based on 3 different options, specifically by name, or by two dropdown menus, one for "instrument" and one for "genre" 

Clicking on a user will take you to their profile, where you can view their specific details they wish to share. You have the ability to send them a friend request. When friend requests are accepted, you are then able to privately send messages between each other. For any reason, you may also remove that person from your personal friends list, and will no longer be able to send or receive messages between the two of you. 

This is a simple and straightforward social network that anyone can utilize, and will continue to grow in features.
